//! state-shift is a procedural macro crate designed to:
//! - hide away the complexities come with type-state pattern,
//! - make your code more readable and maintainable,
//! - and still benefit from the power of type-state pattern.
//!
//! Type-state is a design pattern that leverages the type system to enforce valid states and transitions at compile time.
//! This crate provides attribute macros to transform structures and methods into type-safe stateful components,
//! ensuring that methods are only callable in valid states, and enforcing transitions between them.
//!
//! Macros:
//!
//! - `#[require]`: Enforces that a method can only be called when the provided state is active..
//! - `#[switch_to]`: Modifies the return type of methods to switch between states.
//! - `#[states]`: Defines the valid states for a given type and generates corresponding marker structs and trait implementations.
//! - `#[type_state]`: Transforms the struct into type-state compatible form, using state slots and default states.

/// Arguments:
/// - `state_slots` -> if you want to track multiple states at the same time
/// - `default_state` -> the initial state of your struct, you must provide a one of the states defined in the `#[states]` macro
///
/// also protects your struct from getting initialized with random types/states
/// by enforcing sealed-trait bounds on the states.

/// What it does:
/// - defines the set of states that a type can transition between,
/// - generates marker structs for these states
/// - seals these traits and structs with `TypeStateProtector trait` for each state,
/// - provides the necessary `struct_name` information to `#[require]` macro
///
/// Also:
/// - consumes `#[require]` macro and does the things mentioned in `#[require]` macro's inline docs, which are:
/// - generates a specific `impl` block for each method,
/// - adds the required types and generics to the generated `impl` blocks,
/// - adds the hidden `_state` field to the `Self { }` struct, so you don't have to worry about anything regarding type-state-pattern

/// - name of the impl block (name of the struct)
/// - generics
/// - lifetimes
